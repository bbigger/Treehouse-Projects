# Treehouse Projects

This repository is a place to share my coursework and projects from [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/home). I am a fan of Treehouse. I enjoy their courses and it helps me to stay strong in the fundamentals.

The following courses pertain to full stack web development. This README.md file is a living document that will change to reflect the projects and coursework I add to the repository. Courses listed are on my TODO list. If the box is checked, the course has been completed and will have a folder containing the completed coursework when possible.

### Courses:

- [x] SQL Basics (Course uses SQL Playground)
- [] Ruby on Rails 5 Basics
- [] Rails Routes and Resources
- [] Active Record Associations in Rails
